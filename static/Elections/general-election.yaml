A General Election takes place once every 5 years in all parts of the UK, and elects 650 members
of the House of Commons, who represent the people of the UK and have the power to make or unmake
any laws. It is the most important type of election as the party with the highest number of
elected MPs after the election has control of the UK government.

## When
Since the Fixed Term Parliaments Act 2011, the date of UK General Elections has been fixed.
Prior to this, they took place whenever the Prime Minister asked the Queen to dissolve parliament
(or when the government resigned, or a few other sets of circumstances. Now though, elections
mainly only happen on their scheduled date. The first under the new law was 2015, however the
House of Commons can vote to hold an election early, as happened in 2017 - meaning the next
election will happen in 2022... presuming no further snap elections are called.

## Who
The election takes place in all parts of the UK. To vote you have to be 18 on the day of
the poll, a British, Irish or qualifying Commonwealth citizen, be resident at an address
in the UK (or a UK citizen living abroad who has been registered to vote in the UK in the
last 15 years).
