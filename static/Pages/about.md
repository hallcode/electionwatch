# About

Election Watch UK is a organisation with the task of monitoring the dangers
posed by elections to residents of the United Kingdom.

As we have seen in recent years, elections and referenda can be called at
any time and without very much warning. This can cause economic damage and
can catch candidates and campaigners by surprise.

To help mitigate the effects, Election Watch provides notices with guidance
detailing how likely an election is to take place.

We also keep track of scheduled elections and publish the dates.

## How do we decide the levels?
The threat levels are decided by a secret committee... actually, a subreddit
[/r/ElectionWatchUK](https://reddit.com/r/ElectionWatchUK) where we discuss
politics and debate what the level should be. The mods then update the site 
and write a little post explaining the rationale.

Obviously... the site shouldn't be taken too seriously.
